# Quarty

Quarty is an educational music theory game, designed to use gamification and edutainment to teach music theory through puzzles and play. Quarty was developed for my honours degree in Creative Music Production with IADT. Currently designed to run on Android devices, PC/Mac builds coming soon (and maybe iOS but that's a whole thing).
